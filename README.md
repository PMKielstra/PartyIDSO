# Operation Pantheon: A Party Game from Turtle Bay

*The Team from Turtle Bay: Operation Pantheon* is a collaborative, puzzle-solving party game.  Over the course of an evening, players will crack codes, unravel mysteries, and face down a threat that could reshape the internet as we know it!  All you need to provide is a computer, a TV, and a WiFi network.  Everything else happens on players' phones.

This is a sequel to [*The Team from Turtle Bay*](https://github.com/PMKielstra/EscapeIDSO/).  You don't need to have played it to play this one.

## Setup

Download the most recent version of the game from the Releases section.  Further instructions can be found in the "Checklist" and "Technical" files inside the "Docs" folder.
