# Organizer's Checklist

If you plan to play the game, do not read this document. It contains spoilers.

## Equipment

* A computer to run the server.
* A TV or large screen with some sort of speakers to display the "feature page" (show intro and outro videos, display QR codes for people to join the game, and alert players to new puzzles).
* A mobile device for the gamemaster (probably you).

## Before the day

* Find someone to act as the technical expert.  This will require installing and running Node.js server software.  If you know what that means without looking it up, you're more than capable.

## Before playing

* Launch the game server and follow the instructions that you see.  This will walk you through setting up the gamemaster's device and the feature display.

## During play

* Keep track of player progress, ambience in the room, and so forth, and decide when to trigger new puzzles.  There are four puzzle-solving stages, plus a final stage which will immediately play the conclusion video when triggered.
