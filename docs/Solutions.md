# Hints and Walkthrough

This document provides general hints, some specific hints for each puzzle, and full solutions. They may not be the optimal hints. Read them ahead of time and make such changes as you feel necessary based on your target audience.

It goes without saying that this is entirely spoiler territory.

## General Hints

* Everything you need to solve the puzzles is on your devices, although a pen and paper is helpful.
* Not everything you need can be found on the game site.  You'll have to use other apps or websites too.
* The puzzles will require some collaboration to solve.

## Specific Hints and Solutions

### What do I do first?

* Log in to IDSONet, read the first message, and complain about how completely unnecessary the upgrade was and how much you liked Blue Katana.

### What's wireghost's real name?

* Look through his hacker social media page.  Does he leak anything there?
* His arrest record might be useful -- but his name's been blacked out.
* It doesn't look like his name has been completely erased, just covered up.
* **Solution:** Double-click, drag, long press, or otherwise select the text that's covered up on the arrest record.  It's not deleted; it's just got a black bar over it.  Then you can copy and paste it into any other text box.  Wireghost's name is Isaac Yeager.

### How do I break the encryption on the message from wireghost?

* This is a substitution cipher, and you've been given part of the key.
* Other people will have been given other parts of the key.
* Remember: other people will have different-looking messages, but they'll always be encryptions of the same sentence!
* **Solution:** Get some paper or a notes app, and gather a few people together.  Start with a series of blanks the same length as the encrypted sentence.  Everybody fills in the blanks that their devices give them.  The result should be "Pay on time or I get to make an example out of you".  There is no period at the end.

### Where is Alyosha's hardware?

* Look carefully at the sketch map.  Is there anything there that might help you narrow it down?
* There can't be that many offices of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, can there?
* Any maps app will give you a list of them.
* **Solution:** Search Google Maps, Apple Maps, or a competitor for "Texas Commission on Environmental Quality."  You'll get a dozen or so offices in different cities in Texas.  Check each one individually to see if its surroundings look like the sketch map.  Only one matches: El Paso.

### Which payload should I upload to Alyosha?

* That depends on which outcome you think is best.  Uploading payloads "votes" on which ending you get; whichever payload is uploaded by most players determines what happens.
